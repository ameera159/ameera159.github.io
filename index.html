      <h2>Hello my name is Ameera Ibrahim and I am a senior at Thomas A Edison CTE High school. Web Design, and Coding were
        two things that were brought into my life unexpectedly. When I came to Thomas Edison, I was randomly assigned to Web Design, 
        and since I have picked up a passion for it. Coding and Designing web pages allows me to express myself through my work.
        In my opinion,  It is a career that will have both the customer and servicer satisfied in the end. </h2>
