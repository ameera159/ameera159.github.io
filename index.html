      <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hello my name is Ameera Ibrahim and I am a senior at Thomas A Edison CTE High school. Web Design, and Coding were
        two things that were brought into my life unexpectedly. Coding and Designing web pages allows me to express myself through my work.
        In my opinion, It is a career that will have both the customer and servicer satisfied in the end.</p>
